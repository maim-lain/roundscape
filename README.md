Talk  to  Ruksana:
in  the  camp,  talk  to Ruksana about Murkhal’s plans and how to counter his operations. She will offer to join the party and to have sex with a male player. With  or  without  Ruksana,  proceed  east  to Slinsk,  were  the  player  will  be  able  to  get  in  a boat to the various locations she indicated. The next  three  quests  can  be  completed  in  any order,  but  the  Novos  quest  has  higher  level encounters, so it’s recommended to leave it for last.

Ruksana’s Affection: 
+1 if you believe her (Farm Origin only) 
-1 if you do not (Farm Origin only) 
+2 sleeping with her (Males only) 
-2 for saying she’s disgusting (Males only) 
+1 for sleeping in the camp (females only) 
-1 for not sleeping in the camp (females only) 
+1 for gladly accepting her 
-2 for refusing and saying she’s a savage
